- 👋 Hi, I’m @fthzkrtn
- 👀 Hi dear people, I'm a full-stack software architect who is an also a polyglot software engineer and over-thinker. It was not my choice to be a full-stack engineer, however the companies I used to work for, nobody wanted to neither write front-end codes, administer systems and servers or back-end vice versa. Since, I'm a curious one, I did not lay down and learnt whatever the project needed and implement. This is a short story how I became a full-stack. I know this is not a Disney+ series or Netflix movie, but it was a fantastic journey for me and my team mates as well. Hope, you guys may consider to learn more about and contact me further.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science, machine learning within a cloud infrastructure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects which are currently developing by lots of opensource volunteers.
- 📫 How to reach me? You already did, didn't you?
